              <div className="accordion-body">We at TAM do our best in being as versatile as we can, this shows by our ground breaking policies (explained under a different FAQ) and the array of options on offer. In a company owned pre used dealership you are restricted to one brand, having to compare the cars side by side with other brands and models is a task as it is time consuming for you to move around showrooms trying to find the best suitable option. We are a one stop shop where you can compare cars from all the luxury car brands which are on offer under one roof. For Example :- Mercedes Benz S class vs BMW 730ld vs Audi A8 vs Maserati Quattro Porte, you can physically sit and feel each car individually to have a clear and a better understanding as to which one is tailor made for your comfort and style, where else do you have this ease of buying?</div>
